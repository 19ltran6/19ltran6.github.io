<p>Bat Catch is an easy game that features the player as a bat. The objective of the game is simple, just catch the butterflies to keep the bat from starving!</p>
<br>
<h4>1. Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h4>
<p>I learned that programming a game is very similar to programming a website through html. The codes have to be specific and no matter what happens, the computer will try 
<br>its best to run through the code until the end. This might come with some conflict but it can be easily fixed. I also noticed that numbers play an important role
<br> in the programming. For example, it was important to note the values of the x and y axes in order to program where the butterflies would go, and be careful of using the data variable.
</p>
<br>
<h4>2. Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h4>
<p>I had troubles understanding the code and made many mistakes that involved codes that conflicted. I resolved theses problems by going over the entire code to understand
<br>each code's purpose and finally found the conflicting codes.</p>
<br>
<h4>3. What aspects of your game do you like best?</h4>
<p>I liked how the game incorporated movement for both the player and the game sprites. It made the game interactive and enjoyable.</p>
<br>
<h4>4. If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h4>
<p>I would have liked to fix the buggy movement of the butterflies and include sounds to make the game more interactive.</p>
